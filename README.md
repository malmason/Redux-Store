# Redux-Store 🏪

![header](./images/header.jpg)


## 📝Description
```
Redux-Store is a MERN stack application that allows you to purchase products online and checkout using a third-party payment processing site. This site
used a REST based backend to handle all application routing and has been 
updated to use a GraphQL based routing solution. It has also been modified 
to use Redux for global state tracking in a store instead of a React based solution.
```
